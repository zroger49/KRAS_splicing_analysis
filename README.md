# KRAS Splicing Analysis
Code for the analysis of splicing in KRAS inhibited cell line


## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

KRAS mutations are found in approximately **40% of colorectal cancers (CRCs)** and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. While targeting KRAS has shown some therapeutic promise, treatment resistance remains a major challenge. Previous transcriptomic analyses revealed that the **unfolded protein response and WNT/Î²-catenin signaling** pathways are selectively upregulated in KRAS-silencing-sensitive cell lines, suggesting distinct molecular responses to oncogene inhibition.

However, the **impact of KRAS inhibition on alternative splicing** remains underexplored. Given that aberrant splicing is a known driver of tumor progression and cell dedifferentiation, this pilot project investigates **splicing entropy** as a proxy for transcriptomic diversity following KRAS knockdown.

## ðŸ§ª Cell Lines Studied

- **KRAS-silencing sensitive**: `HCT116`, `SW480`
- **KRAS-silencing resistant**: `LS174T`, `SW837`

Each cell line was analyzed under **control** and **KRAS-inhibited** conditions to compare splicing entropy levels and evaluate reproducibility across replicates and cell line groupings.

## ðŸ“Š Methods

- **Splicing Entropy Analysis**: Quantifies transcript diversity within each sample.
- **Pairwise Comparisons**: Control vs. KRAS-silenced samples for each cell line.
- **Group-Level Analysis**: Combined comparison of sensitive vs. resistant cell lines.
